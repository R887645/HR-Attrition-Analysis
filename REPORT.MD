# Introduction

Employee attrition remains one of the most pressing challenges for organizations today. High turnover not only disrupts operations but also increases recruitment and training costs. 
This project was designed to address that challenge through data. Using Power BI, I conducted a detailed analysis of HR attrition data to uncover the underlying causes of employee turnover, visualize key trends, and provide measurable, actionable insights that HR teams can use to strengthen retention strategies.

The project demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can transform HR decision-making, converting raw employee data into clear, evidence-based insights that support proactive talent management.

# Project Description:
The dataset used for this analysis contained **1,470** employee records with over 35 variables, including demographics, job role, salary, tenure, satisfaction level, performance, and work conditions.
The core goal was to explore what factors most influence attrition, which employee segments are at higher risk, and how HR can act on these insights to reduce turnover.

# Objectives:
- To analyze and visualize company-wide attrition patterns using Power BI.
- To identify measurable factors most associated with employee turnover.
- To build a dashboard that provides real-time attrition monitoring and departmental insights.
- To deliver data-backed recommendations that could reduce attrition by at least **20–25%** if implemented effectively.

# Process and Methodology:
## 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation:
- Imported HR data into Power BI and prepared it using Power Query.
- Managed missing data, standardized formats, and created new calculated columns for analysis.
- Built DAX measures to compute key metrics such as Attrition Rate, Average Tenure, Job Satisfaction Index, and Turnover Cost.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted in-depth visual exploration using Power BI charts and filters.
- Revealed that the Sales Department accounted for 26% of total attrition, while employees with low job satisfaction were 33% more likely to leave.
- Found that employees who worked overtime had a 45% higher attrition probability than those who didn’t.
- Identified that mid-career professionals (aged 31–40) were the most affected group.

## 3. Dashboard Development:
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring KPI cards, heatmaps, slicers, and trend lines.
- Included department-based filters, enabling HR teams to drill down by job role, satisfaction level, and years at the company.
- Highlighted key insights visually to make attrition analysis accessible to non-technical users.

## 4. Insights & Recommendations:
- **Top 5 attrition drivers:** Overtime, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, Years at Company, and Work–Life Balance.
- Recommended HR interventions such as flexible scheduling, promotion-based incentives, and department-specific engagement programs.
- Estimated potential reduction in attrition by **20–25%** through targeted policy changes based on analysis findings.

# Key Findings (Quantifiable Results):
- **Overall Attrition Rate:** 16.1%
- **Highest Attrition Department:** Sales (26%)
- **High Overtime Employees:** 45% higher likelihood of leaving
- **Low Satisfaction Employees:** 33% higher attrition risk
- **Projected Outcome:** Retention improvement up to **25%** with recommended interventions

# Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Tool:** Power BI
- **Core Features Used:** Power Query, DAX, Calculated Columns, KPI Cards, Slicers, Heatmaps
- **Data Source:** HR Attrition Dataset (CSV format)
- **Skills Applied:** Data Cleaning, Visualization Design, Insight Interpretation, KPI Measurement

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Power BI can convert HR data into measurable business intelligence. By visualizing patterns in attrition and identifying quantifiable risk factors, the analysis provided HR teams with a data-driven foundation for decision-making.
Through the dashboard, HR managers can now monitor turnover trends, identify at-risk groups, and measure the impact of retention strategies in real time — ultimately enabling a smarter, more proactive approach to workforce management.
